+--------+--------------+	

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?


	Findings Explanation:-
	
There is no correlation between reviews count and also with the total fans. 
This is because, as shoWn in the data below, those user with the high review_count 
does not necessarily have a high number of fans and vice versa. Referring to user 
name 'Rebecca', the review_count is only 6 , with the higher total fans of 69. 
in comparative with user name 'Gerald' that has the highest number of review_count 
of 2000 but the total fans is only 253, lowe than the review count. We can also see the 
huge difference in the reveiew_count for user name 'Princeton' in comparison with 'Rebecca' 
for 370 but the fans total is around the same number. 


	SQL code used to arrive at answer:


SELECT name, review_count, fans
FROM user
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY fans DESC

INFERENCES & ANALYSIS

8. For this analysis, I chose 'Las vegas' city and 'Restaurants' category. 

--> Explanation : In the data provided, only 4 restaurants can be found / derived from the 
record under the category of Restaurants in Las Vegas. 


-----------SQL CODE-----------
SELECT c.business_id, b.name, b.stars
FROM business b 
LEFT JOIN category c
ON c.business_id = b.id 
WHERE c.category = 'Restaurants' AND b.city ='Las Vegas'

----------Result---------------

+------------------------+---------------------+-------+
| business_id            | name                | stars |
+------------------------+---------------------+-------+
| 1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q | Jacques Cafe        |   4.0 |
| 1CP8aJa8ILlfM5deroar0Q | Wingstop            |   3.0 |
| 1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA | Big Wong Restaurant |   4.0 |
| 36PyJL7VPM6Xd6agqXj5RQ | Hibachi-San         |   4.5 |
+------------------------+---------------------+-------+

-----------SQL CODE-----------

SELECT 
CASE
    WHEN b.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3  THEN '2-3'
    WHEN b.stars >=4  THEN '4-5'
    ELSE 'Others'
END AS StarCategory
,COUNT (*)
FROM business b  
LEFT JOIN category c
ON c.business_id = b.id 
WHERE c.category = 'Restaurants' AND b.city ='Las Vegas'
GROUP BY StarCategory

----------Result---------------

+--------------+-----------+
| StarCategory | COUNT (*) |
+--------------+-----------+
| 2-3          |         1 |
| 4-5          |         3 |
+--------------+-----------+


--> 3 restaurants are in the 4-5 star ratings and only 1 
restaurant is under 2-3 stars category.

Observations:
-->Based on the observations, both groups does not have a big difference from the aspect of 
the hour distribution.Jaques Cafe and Wingstop restaurants are both open around the same hour 
for almost everyday except on Sunday where Jaques Cafe are open from morning until afternoon 
only. However, that does not effect their restaurant ratings and they still rank higher than
WIngstop Restaurant, that opens  at the same hour everyday. No data to review on Hibachi-San 
Restaurant. 


9. Do the two groups chosen have a different number of reviews?
       
---> Big Wong Restaurant has a higher review numbers compared with others and still able to 
maintain a higher rating for their restaurant. We can infer that the Big Wong restaurant is 
a highly popular restaurant.

They'll ask you for tendons too and I don't remember if they charge you extra, but I don't think so. Came with chili oil, scallions, and siracha on the side. It was good, and it's exactly what you expect to get, ramen and beef. Great flavor and the broth was well seasoned. |

10. Anything to infer based on the lacation for the 2 groups? 

--> Based on the location, the longitude data from the result has shown that the neighborhood in 'Chinatown' is a popular place
to open a restaurant. Big Wong Restaurant and Wingstop is nearby to each other and both are getting a 
high traffic reviews, although the star ratings for Wingstop is lower in comparison. Therefore, even if the data is limited, we can infer that based 
on the current data shown, in Las Vegas, Chinatown area is a popular place to operate .

12. Predicting the overall star rating for a business based on their category. 
         
         
      I have chosen to predict the businesses star ratings and categorize them based on the 
business types. Then, for each categories, we can separate the data based on the 
total_business, the average, the minimum and the maximum data. For the star data, there are 
9 ratings variation for each of the businesses which are 
(1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5 and 5.0). Next, the result was arranged in the 
descending order of the total_business. 

	Therefore, based on the data shown, we can see how certain business categories have a range of 
star ratings and we somehow can predict that the certain business USUALLY receives star ratings within 
those range. 

	For example, referring to the 'Automotive' category, with the total of 9 total_businesses,
the star range that this category will receive is between 3.5 to 5.0. However, most of the businesses received 
the rating of 4.5, and thus we can predict that automotive industry or category will usually obtain the rating of 4.5. 


--SQL code--
SELECT c.category
,COUNT(b.id) AS total_business
,AVG(b.stars)AS average_star
,MIN(b.stars)AS minimum_star
,MAX(b.stars)AS maximum_star
FROM  business b 
LEFT JOIN category c 
ON c.business_id = b.id 
GROUP BY c.category
ORDER BY total_business DESC

                  
 Output:-
